Using the imblearn , I'll use a logistic regression model to compare 2 versions of a dataset. First, I’ll use the original data. Next, I’ll resample the data by using RandomOverSampler. In both cases, I’ll get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
