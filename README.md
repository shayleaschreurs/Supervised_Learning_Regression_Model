Using the imblearn library , I will use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of a dataset. First, I’ll use the original data. Second, I’ll resample the data by using RandomOverSampler from the imblearn library. For both cases, I’ll get the count of the target classes, train a logistic regression classifier, calculate the balanced accuracy score, generate a confusion matrix, and generate a classification report.
